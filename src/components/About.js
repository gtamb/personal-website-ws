                    Over the years I have developed a strong interest in game development. This had resulted in experience working with Unity, Ren'Py, and various other game engines and frameworks on different platforms.

                    When I'm not coding, I enjoy playing video games, reading fanstasy novels, and making sourdough bread, to varying success.
