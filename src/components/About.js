                  <p>
                    I'm Gillian Tamblyn, a recent grad from the undergarduate Computer Science progam at the University of Victoria. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In recent years I have developed a strong interest in game development, and have experience working with Unity, Ren'Py, and various other game engines and frameworks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I'm not coding, I enjoy playing video games, reading fanstasy novels, and making sourdough bread, to varying success.
