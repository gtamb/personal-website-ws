                    I have worked as a research assistant at the University of Victoria, where I was a key contributor to several projects involving data collection and analysis, spanning everything from textual to image data extracted from multiple industry sources.

                <p>
                     After that, I was employed by Cognitive 3D as a Software Engineering Intern, where I developed VR demos in multiple game engines, that highlighted the capabilties of my employer's cutting edge cross-platform SDK. This work included creating a demo from scratch in Playcanvas, and then taking over, refactoriung, and completing another more extensive demo in Unity

                    I have participated in multiple game jams, including in a 3D Graphic and Rendering Microdential program hosted by the Univeristy of Victoria. Both these experiences required creating a game within a team in a set amount of time, from 2 days to a week.
