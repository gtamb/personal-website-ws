                    I have worked as a research assistant at the University of Victoria, where I worked on several projects involving data collection and analysis.

                <p>
                     After that, I worked with Cognitive 3D as a Software Engineering Intern, where I worked on developing VR demos in multiple game engines, creating one from scratch in Playcanavas, and taking and up and finishing one in Unity.

                    I have participated in multiple game jams, including in a 3D Graphic and Rendering Microdential program hosted by the UNiveristy of Victoria. Both these experiences required creating a game within a team in a set amount of time, from 2 days to a week.
